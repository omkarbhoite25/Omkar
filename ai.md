# [Neural Networks & Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html) by _Michael Nielsen_
#### <font color="red">Review: The book gives good insights in to the basics of the neural nework and deep learning, it's a very well structured book representing the detail intuitions into the basic of neural network form backpropogation, cost functions, weight initiallization etc. It also provides good understaning of machine learning & neural network along with a detailed mathematical analysis. </font>


# Started with TensorFlow.
## Steps to install _TensorFlow_:
### 1. Install <font color="green"> _Python_ </font> (In my case it's a <font color="green">_Windows_</font> Laptop) 
### 2. Open Command Prompt (<font color="green">_Windows Key + R_ </font>and than type <font color="green">_cmd_</font> or you can use other ways too.)
### 3. Check for <font color="green">_pip_</font></font> and its version too (Usually the latest version of the python has inbuilt pip; if not install and upgrade it.)
### 4. Install <font color="green">_TensorFlow_</font> using pip. (use pip command <font color="green">_pip install tensorflow_</font> to instal TensorFlow).
### 5. Wait till all the files are downloaded and the TensorFlow gets installed.
### 6. Check whether the TensorFlow has been installed properly by using <font color="green">_import tensorflow_</font> command and lok if no error occur.

# Errors installing the _Tenorflow_.

### In my case the error was <font color="green">_ImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found._</font>; the solution to this was to downgrade TensorFlow to version 2.0.0 using command <font color="green">_pip install tensorflow==2.0.0_</font>
