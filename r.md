## Fabrication of Micropillars and Study of Polariton Laser
Learned Photolithographic technique using LW405 laser writer and created micropillars to to study the
	enhancement of the DBR reflectivity for the given Braggs wavelength. Build MATLAB simulations for generating graphs for reflectivity vs wavelength for
	DBR and studied how the DBR reflectivity changes as the function of refractive index of the dielectric medium, insertion of spacer between DBR, multi-layer
	DBR, and multi-layer DBR with spacer.
  
  ## Building Gigahertz Transimpedance amplifier for low temperature RF amplification and shot noise measurement
  Developed a technique to build a
	miniature size printed circuit board for implementing the transimpedance amplifier circuit and also studied how to troubleshoot the difficulties like EMI, PCB
	board capacitance and cryostat effect that hamper the operation of the amplifier for measuring the signal in RF region and signal amplification.
