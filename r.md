## [_FABRICATION OF MICROPILLARS AND STUDY OF DISTRIBUTED BRAGG REFLECTORS TOWARDS EXCITON-POLARITON._](https://github.com/omkarbhoite25/Doc/raw/master/Research%20Report-1.pdf)
<font style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;" color="Black"> With the state-of-the-art technology of LW405B laser writer for photolithography I fabricated different structure of copper like disc & pillars of varying dimensions. Modified the MATLAB code meant for two layer DBR into a generalised code for "n" number of layers DBR, also coded the program for DBR with spacer in it, for studying microcavity and stop-band formation for different Bragg's wavelength and layers of dielectric with different refractive index. Studied exciton-polariton laser, its woking principle and how it produces coherent light without population inversion like convential lasers. </font>

## [_BUILDING GIGAHERTZ TRANSIMPEDANCE AMPLIFIER FOR LOW TEMPERATURE RF AMPLIFICATION AND SHOT NOISE MEASUREMENT._](https://github.com/omkarbhoite25/Doc/raw/master/Research%20Report-2.pdf)
 <font style="font-family:Comic Sans MS;" color="Black">  Developed a technique to build a miniature printed circuit board for implementing the TIA circuit and also studied how to troubleshoot the problems like EMI, parasitic capacitance etc.., that hamper's the operation of the amplifier for measuring the signal in RF region and also signal amplification. Analyzed commercially available TIA to see whether it meets the specification specified by the manufacturer. </font>
