# PROJECTS
## _Design and development of an automated testing equipment for an switch mode power supply (SMPS) & its analysis and 	data acquisition using LabVIEW._

## _Studied the working of gyroscope \& accelerometer for determining the spatial position of the drone in 3-Dimensonal Space and also to calculate it's velocity. Studied YPR parameters of drone and implement it to have a controlled positioning of the drone in 3-D Space_

## _To design a object counter circuit using IC 4026 CMOS Decade Counter/ Divider._

## _To design a regulated power supply using IC 7805 \& IC 7905 and to build a printed circuit board to implement the circuit._

# SEMINAR
